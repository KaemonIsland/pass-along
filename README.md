# pass-along
A brand new social media platform for passing along notes to random strangers!

## What is this?

The idea for this social media app is to be selfless. Send a random stranger a recipe, a poem, a short story. Share something awesome that has happened to you!

Please, do not share ANY identifiable information on these notes! It's meant to be anonymous

Currently you can only send messages containing text, or markdown enriched text.

Once you've finished your message pass it along! It'll be sent to another Pass Along user!

Once you receive a note you can do a few things.

Pass it Along! - Wow you got a cool note, someone else would enjoy this, let's pass it along.
Add to it! - Have something to add to someones creation? Building a unique story? Add to it!
Tear it up! - Don't want others to see this message? Was it destined to be yours and yours alone? Tear it up!

After two-weeks a note will be automatically passed along to avoid users who are away.
